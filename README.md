# phase-space-locomotion-planner

A hybrid phase space planner for rough terrain locomotion which includes the following key components: (i) a step transition solver that enables dynamically tracking non-periodic keyframe states over various types of terrains, (ii) a robust hybrid automaton to effectively formulate planning and control algorithms, (iii) a steering direction model to control the robot’s heading, (iv) a phase-space metric to measure distance to the planned locomotion manifolds, and (v) a hybrid control method based on the previous distance metric to produce robust dynamic locomotion under external disturbances。

This is a MATLAB algorithm implementation of the demos in the following paper:

Ye Zhao, Benito Fernandez and Luis Sentis. "[Robust Optimal Planning and Control of Non-Periodic Bipedal Walking with A Centroidal Momentum Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06345.pdf)," The International Journal of Robotics Research. 36(11): 1211-1243. September, 2017.
